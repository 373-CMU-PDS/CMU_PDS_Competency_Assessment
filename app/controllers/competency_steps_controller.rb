class CompetencyStepsController < ApplicationController

  # Because of the number of steps and amount of information being entered, the
  # process of creating a competency relies on session.
  #
  # IMPORTANT NOTE: because so much data is being stored in the session at one
  # time, our system uses a session table in the databse to store session info.
  # This change was made in the /config/initializers/session_store.rb file;
  # Google search hwo to handle changing this if need be.
  #
  # This controller uses the Wicked gem, which allows the creation process to be
  # broken up into multiple steps. Each step calls the 'update' controller
  # method, and the Wicked gem keeps track of the 'step' variable (defined
  # below) to determine which step in the process the user is in. Each step
  # has an associated view with the same name as the step.
  #
  # Two important things to know:
  # 1) The upload controller function is called everytime a submit action is
  # executed on the front end.
  # 2) The show controller function is called before each view is rendered.
  #
  # Example for understanding:
  # If you are on the 'indicators' page and you click the 'submit' (or
  # equivalent) button, the update controller function will be called with the
  # step variable equal to 'indicators'. When 'redirect_to next_wizard_path' is
  # executed, the step variable advances to the next step: 'resources'. Before
  # the resources page is rendered, the 'show' controller function is executed.

  # The upload controller function is called when a user decides to use the 
  # upload method rather than the manual method. When this function is called,
  # it does three things:
  # 1) stores the competency name under session[:competency]["name"]
  # 2) gathers the indicator information from the provided indicators file, and
  # stores it under session[:competency]["indicators_attributes"]
  # 3) gathers the resrouces information from the provided resrouces file, and
  # stores it under session[:resources]
  #
  # Finally, it redirects to the :indicators step in the Wicked gem. All the
  # data from the files will be presented and the user can double check all
  # indiators were created correctly. When the user goes to the resources step,
  # they will have to map all indicator-resource relationships manually; the
  # uploaded resources will be presented. The mapping is done manually for two
  # reasons:
  # 1) error prevention
  # 2) it is too complicated to develop an algorithm that will do this
